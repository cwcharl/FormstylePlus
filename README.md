FormstylePlus, named partly after its porpuse and partly for its reliance on the CSS adjacent sibling selector(+), is a jQuery plugin for converting inputs (checkboxes and radios) and select menus into an easily stylable format.

FormstylePlus comes with a preformatted stylesheet (split into biolerplate and user-defined styles) but its goal is to enable users to have maximum control over a form's style.

The 'boilerplate' section of the stylesheet should be carefully studied before alteration. You shouldn't really have to touch it, but if you do, just know that stuff will get weird. 

FormstylePlus works in browsers dating back to ie8 -- though ie8 requires a fallback to function in ~almost~ the same manor.

If you have improvements please edit!
