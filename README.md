FormstylePlus, named partly after its porpuse and partly for its reliance on the CSS3 adjacent sibling selector, is a jQuery plugin for converting inputs (checkboxes and radios) and select menus into an easily stylable format.

FormstylePlus comes with a preformatted stylesheet but its goal is to enable users to have maximum control over a form's style.

The boilerplate section of the stylesheet should be carefully studied before alteration. You shouldn't really have to touch it, but if you do, just know that stuff will get weird.
